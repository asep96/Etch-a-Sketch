This project is an etch-a-sketch where the user can drag their mouse across the "canvas" and create a drawing! The user can create a new canvas
by selecting "generate new canvas" and set the number of blocks that make up each side to their choosing (as long as it is between 1-60 blocks).
This project was created using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS.
